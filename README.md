This repo simply holds a list that I keep adding to/removing from articles that I want to read; and posted as to be accessible and editable from anywhere.

After months of sending myself emails on Gmail, I think this is better :)

Added crud operations.

The app is still technically using a single template and uses ng-hide/ng-show for hiding/showing pages. 
Could add ui-router to this at some point for the sake of doing things right, but feel this app seems a bit small for that.

Also, if I make any changes to the list, I need to manually save the list by copy-paste. I'd need a backend for getting that to work via the UI, 
but the task seems a bit trivial for needing to add a whole backend to this.
